## Installation

* Then, on line 52 you need to add your github username to the USERNAME variable
```bash
USERNAME="YourGithubUsername"
```

* Finally, you need to add a personal access token. To do this you need to go to developer settings in the Github settings page. Then go to personal access tokens section and create a new token. You need to click the first box "repo", the box below that called "write:packages", the the box called "read:packages" and click create. Add your token to the TOKEN variable on line 52.
```bash
curl -H 'Authorization: token AddYourTokenHere' https://api.github.com/user/repos -d "$NEWVAR"
```
## Usage
```bash
ctdir new_directory
```
Type the command ctdir and the directory name
```bash
app.py index.html main.css
```
To add new files type them in and add a space. This same format is used for the .gitignore file insertion and the master branch file insertion

Finally, you will be prompted to type in the title of your remote repository. After this you will need to enter in your ssh password to finish the process.
